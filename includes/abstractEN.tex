The main aim of the thesis is to develop tools that would serve for cryptanalyzing the classical ciphers on the grid and the development environment for future cryptanalysts.
The first three chapters are dedicated to theoretical and partly practical information of classical ciphers, MPI communication and the work with the grid hpc.stuba.sk.
The fourth chapter deals with the development environment and its use as well as the implementation of parallel genetic algorithms.
The two final chapters are of an experimental nature and their main aim is to decipher the mono-alphabetic substitution with the help of the parallel genetic algorithms.
